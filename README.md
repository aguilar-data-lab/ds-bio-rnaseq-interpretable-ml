End-to-end RNA-seq analysis with interpretable machine learning for biological insight

# End-to-End RNA-seq Analysis with Interpretable ML

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end RNA-seq analysis pipeline, from raw sequencing data to biologically interpretable machine learning insights

The emphasis is on:
- reproducible data processing
- principled model selection
- interpretability over black-box performance
- clear biological reasoning

## Status
🚧 Project setup phase (Spring 2026)

## Key Questions
- What biological signal can be extracted from this dataset?
- Which modeling approaches are appropriate, and why?
- How do modeling decisions affect interpretability and conclusions?

## Planned Components
- RNA-seq preprocessing and QC
- Feature construction
- Interpretable ML models
- Biological interpretation of results

## Notes
This repository is under active development as part of a graduate portfolio project.
